Snake Game üêç

Overview:
Welcome to the classic Snake Game! This repository contains a simple and addictive implementation of the classic Snake Game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game provides a nostalgic experience for players of all ages, where they control the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail.

Features:
Smooth Controls: The game offers smooth and responsive controls that allow players to maneuver the snake in all directions.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you consume more food and grow longer. Challenge yourself to beat your highest score!
Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or its own tail. You can restart the game with a single click and try to beat your previous performance.
Speed Levels: As the game progresses, the snake's speed increases, making the gameplay more challenging and exciting.
How to Play:
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will automatically move in the direction you choose.
Your goal is to guide the snake to eat the food (represented by a red dot) to grow longer.
The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the playing area or its own tail.
Click the "Restart" button to start a new game after the game over.
